# Amazon-PowerBi-DashBoard

# Project Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze Amazon sales data and create interactive dashboards. This helps in understanding customer behavior, sales performance, and revenue trends, thereby supporting data-driven decisions to improve growth and profitability.

# Process

-- Collected Amazon sales data and verified for missing values, inconsistencies, and anomalies.

-- Cleaned and transformed the dataset to ensure accuracy in sales, orders, fulfillment, and shipment details.

-- Designed the data model in Power BI with relationships, measures (DAX), and calculated fields.

-- Built multiple interactive dashboards to analyze sales by product category, states, cities, shipping type, and fulfillment method.

-- Added slicers, drill-through, and map visualizations for dynamic and detailed insights.

# Final Conclusion

To improve Amazonâ€™s sales performance, a strategic growth plan should focus on popular product categories such as T-shirts and Shirts, which contribute the highest revenue. Special attention should be given to high-performing regions like Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Telangana, along with key cities such as Bengaluru and Hyderabad. Standard shipping and Amazon-fulfilled orders dominate, highlighting areas to further optimize logistics and delivery. The approach should also prioritize strengthening B2C sales channels while expanding B2B opportunities, supported by targeted promotions and customer-centric strategies to maximize profitability.
